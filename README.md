# Course Overview

This hands-on training will provide an introductory overview of the basic tools for effective health data science with R, using the tidyverse collection of packages. 

You will learn, through hands-on exercises, how to import data to R, perform common data transformations and pre-processing, visualize, analyse, model and interactively report your results.


## Is this course for me?

This course is aimed at health professionals, researchers, data analysts, post-graduation students or anyone wanting to:

* Start using R as a tool for research or data science,
* Migrate to R from other software (e.g. Excel, Stata, SPSS),
* Expand their data analysis skillset with data cleaning, visualization and interactive reporting.
