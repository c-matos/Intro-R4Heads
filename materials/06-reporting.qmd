## What is ![](https://quarto.org/quarto.png) ?

<br>

-   Unified authoring framework for data science
    - Seamlessly combine **code**, **results** and **prose**
-   Fully reproducible
-   Supports several output formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, Word, Presentations, ...)
    -   Write in one language ([Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)), output to several
-   Command line tool
    -   But don't worry, you won't have to deal with the command line
-   Create websites, blogs, articles, presentations, books, dashboards (in the next version!)

## Why Quarto?

- **Communication** to decision makers
  - Focus on conclusions, not the code behind
- **Collaboration** with other data scientists
  - Interested in conclusions but also the code
- **Environment** to work in
  - Modern day notebook
- Native support for multiple languages 
  - (R, python, Observable, ...)
- You can choose between a **source** and **visual** editor

## Anatomy of a Quarto document

It contains three important types of content:

1.  An (optional) **YAML header** surrounded by `---`.
2.  **Chunks** of R code surrounded by ```` ``` ````.
3.  **Text mixed** with simple text formatting like `# heading` and `_italics_`.
    -   Regular text
    -   Inline code
    -   Figures
    -   Tables
    -   Citations
    -   Cross-references
    -   LaTeX Equations
    -   ...

```

## Quarto citations

- Create a references.bib file in your main project folder
-	Add `bibliography: references.bib` to the YAML header of your .qmd file
- Add citations in bibtext format to references.bib
  - To see an example use `citation(“tidyverse”)` in RStudio
- (Optionally) define a citation style with csl: [path_to_file.csl]
  - csl files can be found here: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles
  - You can refer directly to the online file (e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/american-medical-association.csl)

## Exercises

1. Create a new Quarto document using *File \> New File \> Quarto Document*.  
2. Read the instructions.  
3. Practice running the chunks individually.  
4. Then render the document by clicking the appropriate button.  
5. Verify that you can modify the code, re-run it, and see modified output.
6. Add a hyperlink to the course website, re-run it, and see the modified output
   + https://c-matos.github.io/Intro-R4Heads/
7. Change the output type (html, pdf, docx) and render again (may need some package installation)

## Exercises

- Replicate the document "06-quarto.pdf", using Quarto.
- Create similar documents in docx and html formats
